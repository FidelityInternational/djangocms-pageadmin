Overview
--------

Django CMS Page Admin provides a new PageContent admin which doesn't
include tree functionality. It also displays data from Django CMS Versioning
and Django CMS Version Locking.

Page Admin merely replaces the changelist of PageContent admin
(to use a standard Django admin one), so the rest of functionality
is kept as-is.

Installation
------------

Run::

    pip install djangocms-pageadmin

Add ``djangocms_pageadmin`` to your project's ``INSTALLED_APPS``.
It should appear **after** ``cms`` app in order to override the
default PageContent admin class.

.. code-block:: python

    INSTALLED_APPS = [
        # ...
        'cms',
        # ...
        'djangocms_pageadmin',
        # ...
    ]

Usage
-----

Django CMS Page Admin is a drop-in replacement for the default
PageContent admin provided by the CMS.
